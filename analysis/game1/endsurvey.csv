'}","{'q': 'What was your overarching approach to solve each level?', 'a': 'I approached each level initially with finding a solution using the least amount of lines to accomplish the task. I felt that this approach made it easier for me to see where the ball goes and understand the in-game physics, and then make adjustments whereever needed. I also kept watch for any added conditions and obstacles beforehand, such as the wind blowing in certain directions, which may have made the task more difficult and accounted for these in my design solutions. '}","{'q': 'Did you experience any technical issues while playing the game? If so, describe.', 'a': ""There were times during the levels which had wind blowing where I drew a line, and it looked like the ball had stopped on the line, but it took awhile before the game would reset and allow me to do my next attempt. I'm assuming the in-game wind was still moving the ball at an almost infinitesimally small rate which was preventing the game from resetting at a normal pace since the ball hadn't yet come to a complete halt. It might be a good idea to allow players to manually reset their attempts during levels with wind due to this if possible.  ""}"
