        The goal of the game is to drop a ball into a cup.<br><br>

        You have a magic crayon that allows you to draw tracks directly in the environment. The tracks ARE NOT subject to gravity and float without supports. <i>You can draw (or erase) as many tracks as you want.</i><br><br>

        Meanwhile, the ball IS subject to gravity, and other environmental conditions like wind.<br><br>

        Each round, you have 5 attempts to get the ball in the cup. 
        Once you succeed, you must go to the next round and cannot make edits or replay the round.
        Please do not switch tabs or windows while you play.<br><br>

        It should take about 20 minutes to complete the full game.<br><br>
