# crayon-coaster

Experiment testing how people balance goals for efficient solutions versus unique and interesting solutions, and how populations benefit from weighing the different goals depending on the solution landscape.

Players' goal in the game is to draw paths in environments to make a marble drop in a cup. The game combines drawing and physics using the game framework Phaser 3 (Matter Physics).

## "game" is norming task

Participants (n = 27) play randomly selected 20 trials, varying on level, wind, gravity, and ball size.

## "game1" is training experiment

Participants (n = 72) play 19 trials, with 15 training trials (5 more vs less constrained levels x 3 wind conditions) + 4 critical trials.

## "game2" is human rating task

Human raters (n = 352) rate 33 trials: 10 levels x 3 wind conditions + 3 catch trials

The rated levels were a sample of "game1" training levels. We sampled such that we included all 15 training trials from 15 "game1 designers" from the 2 conditions (30 unique trials). Each trial that a given rater saw was from a unique designer. The ordering and which trials were all randomly selected for each rater.
