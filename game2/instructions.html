        In this task, you’ll act as a judge. 
        We had people play a computer game where they drew tracks to drop a marble into a goal location (a cup). 
        Your job is to look at the solutions they came up with and judge how <i class="instructRateDim">unique</i> they are.
        Here’s what the computer game looks like. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Players try to transport the marble (drop location marked by the <b><font color="#8C328B">purple</font></b> circle) into the <b>black</b> cup. 
        There are obstacles in the game (the <b>black</b> blocks) that make this harder. 
        Marbles bounce off the black blocks.
        Let’s see what happens if we drop the ball without drawing any tracks.
    </p>

    <p>
        Players can draw tracks to guide the ball towards the cup—the tracks are shown in <b><font color=#04A902>green</font></b>. 
        Look, now the ball made it into the cup!

    <p>
        Sometimes there will also be wind that pushes the marble in certain directions (shown by this wind icon in the top right corner of some images). 
        If the wind is facing the right direction (like below), the wind will push the marble rightward.
        If the wind is facing the opposite direction, the wind will push the marble leftward.
        If there is no wind icon, there is no wind pushing the marble.

    <p>
        You will rate <b id="solutionLen">30</b> solutions (on a slider bar) on how <i class="instructRateDim">unique</i> that solution is.
        It should take about 10 minutes to complete the task.<br><br>

        <b>Please pay attention to these instructions -- there will be a quiz at the end. 
            If your answers suggest that you were not paying attention, you may have to repeat the instructions.</b>
